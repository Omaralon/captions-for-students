# Captions for Students Web

Captions for Students is a platform focused on helping deaf university students, attend their classes, generate transcripts in real-time, and use cloud services to save these transcripts in the form of notes. 

- It uses Firebase for user Authentication, Realtime Database and Firestore, which is really handy because it also has a mobile client.

> This application is intended to be used by the **platform administrator, teachers and students**, to check their class transcriptions.

The platform administrator can perform the following actions within it:

1. Create users of type `student` and` teacher`.
2. Add subjects to the platform.
3. Assign students to their subjects within the platform.
4. Assign teachers their subjects, defining their class schedule.
